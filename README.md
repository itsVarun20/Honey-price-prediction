Project Domain: Food Science

This repository contains the dataset used and code for predicting the purity and price of honey samples using machine learning algorithms.

## Overview

This project focuses on predicting the purity and pricing of honey samples based on intrinsic characteristics such as color score, density, water content, pH level, and more. The goal is to develop robust predictive models that accurately capture the complex dynamics of honey quality and pricing.

## Algorithms Used

The following machine-learning algorithms are employed in this project:

*Linear Regression:* A foundational model offering simplicity and interpretability.
*Ridge and Lasso Regression:* These models introduce regularization to address multicollinearity and feature selection.
*Random Forest:* An ensemble method that constructs multiple decision trees independently and aggregates their predictions.
*Gradient Boosting:* Another ensemble method that sequentially builds trees to minimize the loss function, gradually improving predictive accuracy.
*XGBoost:* Extreme Gradient Boosting, known for its scalability, efficiency, and superior performance on large datasets. It leverages parallelization and regularization techniques to enhance predictive accuracy while mitigating overfitting.
