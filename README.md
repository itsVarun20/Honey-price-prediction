Project Domain: Food Science

This repository contains the dataset used and code for predicting the purity and price of honey samples using machine learning algorithms.

## Overview

This project focuses on predicting the purity and pricing of honey samples based on intrinsic characteristics such as color score, density, water content, pH level, and more. The goal is to develop robust predictive models that accurately capture the complex dynamics of honey quality and pricing.
