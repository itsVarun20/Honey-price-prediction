Project Domain: Food Science

In recent years, machine learning has emerged as a transformative tool across industries, offering predictive models that streamline decision-making processes. This project focuses on the domain of food production, specifically honing in on honey production. The accurate assessment of honey purity and pricing is vital for producers and consumers alike, yet traditional methods often rely on subjective judgment or labor-intensive lab analyses. Moreover, the multifaceted nature of honey attributes further complicates the process. To tackle these challenges, this project employs machine learning algorithms to predict honey purity and pricing based on intrinsic characteristics.
